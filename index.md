## Overview

CipherDropX is a cutting-edge library designed for decoding YouTube signatures. This library leverages regular expressions exclusively, ensuring a lightweight and efficient solution for deciphering. It operates without any JavaScript execution or Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) manipulation, providing a fully dynamic parser. The library supports the latest obfuscation techniques, making it a reliable choice for developers and reverse engineers.

### Key Features

- **Regex-Only**: Utilizes regular expressions for all parsing tasks.
- **Dynamic Parsing**: Adapts to changes in YouTube's signature algorithms without requiring updates.
- **No Dependencies**: A lightweight solution with no external libraries needed.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable for custom use cases.
- **Comprehensive Support**: Handles the latest obfuscation methods employed by YouTube.

## Installation

To install CipherDropX, you can clone the repository or download the latest release. For the latter, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Fishcracks/CipherDropX/releases) to find the latest version. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fishcracks/CipherDropX.git
cd CipherDropX
```

### Download and Execute

To get the latest version, download it from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Fishcracks/CipherDropX/releases). Follow the instructions in the release notes to execute the library properly.

## Usage

To use CipherDropX, simply import it into your Python project. Here‚Äôs a basic example:

```python
from cipherdropx import CipherDropX

# Initialize the parser
parser = CipherDropX()

# Decode a YouTube signature
signature = "your_signature_here"
decoded = parser.decode(signature)

print(f"Decoded Signature: {decoded}")
```

### Advanced Usage

For more complex scenarios, you can customize the parser settings. CipherDropX allows you to define specific patterns or adjust the parsing logic to fit your needs.

```python
# Custom parser settings
custom_parser = CipherDropX(patterns=["custom_pattern"])

# Decode using custom settings
decoded_custom = custom_parser.decode("your_signature_here")
print(f"Decoded with Custom Settings: {decoded_custom}")
```

## Supported Topics
